### Description
---
Introducing Blob Mania! The website game for you and your friends to endlessly challenge and compete against each other, with score tracking so you can talk the most trash when you have the most score! Enjoy our art style championed by Alina, our functional game code worked on by all of us, and our login system, securely saving your password. We love games, and we all gained some great experience dealing with the many problems that arise when trying to make a multiplayer browser game. We embraced the challenge and taught ourselves a lot. Go team!
